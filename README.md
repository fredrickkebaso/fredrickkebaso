Great! to see you here. I am Fredrick Kebaso, a biological data science enthusiast and a junior Bioinformatician at the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE). I am keen in application of Bioinformatics, machine learning and deep learning in Genomic data analysis. Currently, I am working on De novo genome assembly and annotation of chemosensory gene annotation of three *hippoboscu* species.
