Great! to see you here. I am Fredrick Kebaso, a biological data science enthusiast. I am keen in application of Bioinformatics skills in Genomics 
. Currently, I am working on De novo genome assembly of *hippoboscus* and comparative genomics of the chemosensory genes of *Glossina* and *hippoboscus*. 
Additionally, I am looking into the application of machine learning and deep learning in genomics.
